                    but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners, the list of which you can also find at. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information
                    and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers
                    to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers
                    will also use this information to monitor, improve, or modify their operations.
